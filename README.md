# Whois API

> A "headless" resume builder

Tired of writing your resume over and over? loosing track of key achievements? Use whois with your favorite static site generator (or whatever client you want) to create an interactive resume to get you the job you want.

Example: next.tailwindemployee.com

## Requirements

If you want to run this you will need to have a [Nova License](https://nova.laravel.com/).

Other than the Nova requirement, this is your standard Laravel application.
